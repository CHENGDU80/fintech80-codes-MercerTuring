                <h3 id="download">Features and basic information of SHIELD +</h3>
                  <p><b>Q1: Why should I choose SHIELD + ?</b>
                <p>A1:  This program is built on three core principles:
                  <p>  &nbsp 1.Transparency in Pricing: Insurance premiums should not be a mystery. Through SHIELD +,
                  each user receives a personalized risk report that outlines how various factors influence their premium.
                  From vehicle history to driver habits, every detail is factored in so you know exactly where your rate
                  stands.
                  <p>  &nbsp 2.Rewarding Safe and Responsible Drivers: As vehicles become safer and drivers increasingly
                  adopt responsible practices, insurance should reward these advancements. With SHIELD +, users who
                  demonstrate a lower risk profile through our comprehensive evaluation process can receive a discount
                  range on their premium, typically between 12% and 20%, potentially making insurance more affordable
                  for responsible drivers.
                  <p>  &nbsp 3.Supporting Stability in the Insurance Market: A balanced and fair insurance market is a
                  cornerstone of social stability. By recognizing individual responsibility and encouraging safer driving,
                  SHIELD + not only reduces premiums for low-risk drivers but also contributes to a fair and sustainable
                  insurance ecosystem.
                  <p>  &nbsp Traditional insurance models often rely on static data, leaving policyholders in the dark about how their
                  premium is calculated. At SHIELD +, we believe in breaking that barrier. Our program provides an
                  alternative that not only clarifies how your rate is determined but also opens the door to potential
                  discounts based on real, relevant data.
                  <p>
                  <p><b>Q2: How does SHIELD + work ?</b>
                  <p>A2: The process is simple and efficient:
                  <p>  &nbsp 1. Basic Premium Model: Initially, a base premium is generated for each user based on their vehicle’s
                  historical data and basic user demographics. This base rate is the foundation, offering a transparent
                  starting point for all users.
                  <p>  &nbsp 2. Risk Assessment Plan: Users have the option to enroll in the SHIELD + plan, where they can fill out a
                  more detailed profile covering factors such as driving habits, vehicle specifications, and lifestyle
                  preferences. Using this information, our advanced algorithm evaluates each user’s risk level on a scale of
                  1 to 4—where Level 1 indicates the lowest risk and Level 4 the highest.
                  <p>  &nbsp 3. Personalized Report and Discount Range: After completing the assessment, each user receives a
                  personalized report that highlights their specific risk factors and suggests a potential discount range on
                  their premium (e.g. 12% to 20%). This range reflects the extent to which their safe driving and
                  responsible practices contribute to lower risk, promoting a pricing structure that is both fair and flexible.
                  <p>  &nbsp 4. Consult with Experts for the Final Discount: With the report in hand, users can consult with our
                  insurance specialists to discuss final premium adjustments based on the detailed assessment. Our team is
                  committed to providing transparent explanations and working with each user to maximize their savings
                  while ensuring optimal coverage
                  <p><b>Q3: What is the advantages of SHIELD + ?</b>
                  <p>A3:   Opting for SHIELD + means embracing a future where insurance is customer-focused, data-driven, and
                  adaptable. Users can actively participate in shaping their insurance premiums rather than passively
                  accepting predefined rates. This program is ideal for those who prioritize transparency, appreciate fair
                  pricing, and wish to see their responsible driving practices reflected in their insurance costs

                <h3 id="starter-template">Data usage and privacy</h3>
                <p><b>Q1: How will my insurance company protect my data ?</b>
                  <p>A1: SHIELD+ Insurance employs high-level encryption measures and data privacy protection protocols that follow local privacy laws and data security standards. All data is accessed, stored and used in a secure and encrypted manner and is used only for risk assessment and premium calculations and is not shared or sold.
                  <p><b>Q2: What self-driving-related data does SHIELD+ use about me ?</b>
                  <p>A2: SHIELD+ primarily uses operational data from self-driving vehicles, including vehicle position, speed, driving mode (automatic or manual), driving time and path. This data is only used for risk assessment and premium calculation.
                  <p><b>Q3: Can I still buy SHIELD+ insurance if I don't agree to share certain data ?</b>
                  <p>A3: SHIELD+ relies on specific data for risk assessment. If consumers choose to limit data sharing, insurers may be able to offer basic coverage options based on limited data, but not fully personalized pricing and discounts.
